    "# Data Versioning\n",
    "\n",
    "Keeping track of versions of your data can be tricky. Historically, data scientists might simply keep copies of all versions of data that they use, and rename them appropriately, which can clutter up your data store or file system, and makes it difficult to truly keep track of which data went with which model (experiment). \n",
    "\n",
    "The notion of having a data version control system, similar to what git does for code, has been around for awhile, and the most popular tools that have emerged to address these needs have been Git LFS and DVC. But, some would argue that using a version control tool for data is unnecessary, so long as the data scientist is disciplined enough to create reproducible data pipelines themselves, and so long as the data sources themselves are managed correctly. Regardless, I think it's useful to give data versioning a try, to understand its limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Version Control (DVC)\n",
    "\n",
    "[DVC](https://dvc.org/) is a tool that can be used to track versions of data, and is used similarly to git. First, let's install DVC using \n",
    "\n",
    "`pip install dvc`  \n",
    "`pip install dvc-s3`\n",
    "\n",
    "from within your environment. There is no need to add this to your requirement.txt file, we are using it only for demonstration purposes. After it's installed you can check the version and help files:\n",
    "\n",
    "`dvc -V`  \n",
    "`dvc -h`\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, in your project root folder you can initialize DVC, similar to initializing a git repo, using \n",
    "\n",
    "`dvc init` \n",
    "\n",
    "From here, you can see that there is a new .dvc folder and a .dvcignore file. The .dvcignore file is similar to .gitignore, you use it to tell DVC if there are certain data files you want DVC to ignore. The .dvc folder contains a config file and a tmp folder, and should also have a .gitignore file. This folder will eventually have a cache folder in it as well. We will talk about this in a minute. First, let's add the .dvc/config file and .dvcignore file to git. \n",
    "\n",
    "`git add .dvc/config .dvcignore .dvc/.gitignore`  or `git add .` might work if you don't have a bunch of other uncommited changes.  \n",
    "`git commit -m 'add dvc'`  \n",
    "\n",
    "You may want to push these to your Github repo at this point.\n",
    "\n",
    "`git push origin main`  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can start version-controlling data. Let's add a dataset to our data/ folder. You may already have data there, but you can also use any toy dataset that you want to use for practicing with DVC. I will add the adult.data file into my data/ folder and then add it to DVC (again, similar to git) using\n",
    "\n",
    "`dvc add data/adult.data`\n",
    "\n",
    "I can now see an adult.data.dvc file in the data/ folder. This file is important, and this is the one that we will keep under version control with git, so let's go ahead and add it now.\n",

    "`git commit -m 'add adult data dvc file'`\n",

    "\n",
    "`cat data/adult.data.dvc`  \n",
    "\n",
    "You will notice an md5 hash value. If you now go back to the .dvc folder you will now see a cache folder has been created. In the cache folder you will see a new folder in there with a name that should match the first couple of digits of the md5 hash value. Navigate into that folder and you'll see that adult.data is now in there.\n",
    "\n",
    "`cd .dvc/cache/files/md5/{folder name}`  \n",
    "`cat {file name}`  \n",
    "\n",
    "This cache is important, it is how DVC will keep track of your different data versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To truly take advantage of data version control, we should store our data somewhere else, rather than locally. This way, your coworkers can access the same data. You can store the data in any number of cloud storage options. We may attempt to do this in a future lab.\n"

    "### DVC Pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical pipeline for a modeling experiment might have the following stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Import data and create train/validation/test splits   \n",
    "- Clean data and create features  \n",
    "- Model training  \n",
    "- Model evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "DVC is capable of keeping track of an entire pipeline like this, though for our purposes we will not include model training and evaluation. \n",
    "\n",
    "We've already created the first stage of our pipeline when we added our train and test datasets to DVC. To create the next stage in the data pipeline using DVC, we will create a script that reads in our train and test datasets, makes some changes, and outputs two new datasets for use later. We call this script `create_features.py`. This script loads the data, uses a Pipeline (from sklearn) to transform the data, writes the Pipeline to `pipeline.pkl` and the two transformed data sets to `processed_train_data.csv` and `processed_test_data.csv`. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can use DVC to create this new *stage* in our pipeline. DVC will run the code in `create_features.py`. We can create pipelines by specifying them in a `dvc.yaml` file. So, let's create a `dvc.yaml` file in the root directory of our project and add the following pipeline to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "stages:\n",
    "  prepare:\n",
    "    cmd: python src/create_features.py\n",
    "    deps:\n",
    "      - data/adult.data\n",
    "      - data/adult.test\n",
    "      - src/create_features.py\n",
    "    outs:\n",
    "      - data/pipeline.pkl\n",
    "      - data/processed_train_data.csv\n",
    "      - data/processed_test_data.csv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll notice that we list out all of the file dependencies that are needed to run our `create_features.py` script, as well as everything that is output from the script. After creating the `dvc.yaml` file we can run `dvc stage list` to see that the *prepare* stage was created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can run the pipeline using\n",
    "\n",
    "`dvc repro`\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the pipeline is run, we will see several things happen automatically: the outputs of the pipeline will be in the `data` folder, a new file called `dvc.lock` will appear in the root project folder, and the outputs from the pipeline will be added to the `data/.gitignore` file. Take a look at the `dvc.lock` and `data/.gitignore` file before moving on.\n",
    "\n",
    "From here, you should add the new `dvc.lock`, `dvc.yaml`, and the `data/.gitignore` to the git repo, as well as the create_features.py script. Then commit and push to Github. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose your pipeline depends on a set of parameters, for example a random seed for doing train/test splits. We can place those parameter values in a **params.yaml** file, and use DVC and git to keep track of changes to these parameters. We would need to change our script to include the yaml file and set the parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a params.yaml file that looks like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "features:  \n",
    "    chi2percentile: 50\n",
    "    train_path: data/adult.data  \n",
    "    test_path: data/adult.test\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then change the script so that the percentile used for feature selection reads from the yaml file instead of being hard-coded:\n",
    "\n",
    "`import yaml`  \n",
    "`params = yaml.safe_load(open(\"params.yaml\"))[\"features\"]`  \n",
    "`chi2percentile = params[\"chi2percentile\"]`  \n",
    "\n",
    "and update this line:\n",
    "\n",
    "`(\"selector\", SelectPercentile(chi2, percentile=chi2percentile)),`\n",
    "\n",
    "I've included a new version of the script, called `create_features_w_params.py` that you can use for this instead. Now, we'll want to replace the previous pipeline we created in our `dvc.yaml` file by using this new pipeline with parameters. We can simply add the following within our pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "params: \n",
    "      - features.chi2percentile\n",
    "      - features.train_path\n",
    "      - features.test_path\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, run `dvc repro` to see if it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create pipelines using DVC, you can easily reproduce entire pipelines by running `dvc repro`. For example, if we accidentally changed or deleted one of the output files, such as `data/processed_test_data.csv`, we can simply run `dvc repro` to get it back. In fact, delete both output files and run `dvc repro`. DVC will automatically grab both output files from the cache without needing to rerun the entire script to recreate them.\n"

    "Using the data that you used in the Experiment Tracking lab, use DVC to create a reproducible pipeline for data preprocessing. \n",
    " \n",
    "- Put your datasets in a `data/` folder  \n",
    "- Add your datasets to DVC  \n",
    "\n",
    "At this point you should create a script, called `preprocessing.py`, saved to the `src/` folder, that does only the data preprocessing stages of the pipeline. Any modeling stages can be kept in a separate script. You may need to first work inside of a notebook to finalize your code. Feel free to just copy and paste any data processing code that you previously used on Lab 2.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Once your script works, \n",
    "\n",
    "- in the root directory of your project, create the `dvc.yaml` file. The `params.yaml` file is optional.  \n",
    "- run `dvc repro` to create the output files.  \n",
    "- commit and push changes to Github.  \n",
    "- remember, do not add your data files to git.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get credit for this lab, I should be able to see that you've created a pipeline for your project data. There should be: \n",
    "\n",
    "- a preprocessing.py file in the `src/` directory,  \n",
    "- *.dvc files for your datasets in the `data/` directory,     \n",
